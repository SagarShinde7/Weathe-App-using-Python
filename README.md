# Weather App Using Python

This Python program allows users to retrieve weather information using the OpenWeatherMap API. Users can input a city name, and the program will display the current weather conditions for that city.

## Features

- Current weather conditions: The program displays the current temperature, weather description, humidity, and wind speed for the specified city.
- Error handling: The program handles errors gracefully and notifies the user if the city is not found or if there's an issue with retrieving weather information.

## Requirements

- Python 3.0
- Requests library (can be installed via `pip install requests`)

## Usage

1. Clone the repository or download the Python file (`main.py`) directly.
2. Replace `"YOUR_API_KEY"` in the `get_weather` function with your actual API key from OpenWeatherMap.
3. Run the program using Python: `python main.py`.
4. Enter the name of the city when prompted.
5. View the current weather conditions for the specified city.
